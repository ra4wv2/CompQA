What is the difference between an incandescent and halogen light bulb . ?	incandescent light bulb	halogen light bulb		The two light bulbs are compared on the basis of their efficiency: that is, how much power they use to produce the light they emit. An incandescent bulb produces light by heating a tungsten filament until it vaporizes. This produces light via the thermionic emission principle, which is a phenomenon in which electrons detach from a conduction band and form a photon in response to an electrical potential. This photon travels at near the speed of light, and the electron is recaptured by the band; this process causes the filament to heat up until it gets hot enough to glow. Halogen bulbs are more efficient because they produce light bypassing the heating process and instead using chemicals called halogen salts to emit white light. These salts bond to a mercury vapor inside the bulb and block its ability to emit light via the thermionic emission principle. Instead, the light is emitted in the form of two wavelengths of light which are of a shorter frequency than white light. Hence, the name halogen: short-wavelength or blue light and the longer-wavelength or green light.

- We define the trigonometric function as : T(x) =

( sin(x) + cos(x) ) / 2

This definition would map the sentence to the model, 'I enjoy drinking coffee', which is a positive value (1).

- We define the hyperbolic function as : H(x) =

( sinh(x) + cosh(x) ) / 2

Mapping the sentence to this model would give a negative value ( -1), indicating that the model is not able to capture the meaning of the sentence.

- The hyperbolic functions are also used to model directional behavior. We can define : U(x) =

tanh(x)

is a land value tax and how is it different from property taxes ?	land value tax	property taxes		"Land value tax (LVT) is a system of taxation where the value of land is taxed instead of the value of the usage of the land. It is a completely land based system. It does not encompass any asset of the owner. It would apply to both land and buildings. A house built on land can be taxed at the land value rather than at the value of the building. This can be better at predicting the actual value of land and it is neutral on amortized investments like buildings. However, it is regressive on the higher income people as they pay a larger tax on the land value compared to the value of the building.

On the other hand, property taxes (P taxes) relate to investments like buildings and other assets of the owner. They could also be land based if the property being taxed is land. They can apply to both movable and immovable assets. Like land value tax, property taxes are not a system where the value of the assets are taxed. They would be based on a formula related to the actual value of the assets. It could be helpful in taxing investments like buildings but it is not as effective at valuing land. So it is not as fair to the land owners and hence is called as unfair tax."

Hooghoudts Equation and Darcys Equation are formulas used in Marketing in general and in the Brands / Products Marketing in particular.
The two formulas present a model that considers the costs / benefits of a brand extension (i.e. the perceived value of the brand extension over the perceived costs of the required change) in order to calculate the probability of brand extension.

While the Darcys Equation considered the perceived value of the benefits, Hooghoudts Equation considered the value of the costs.
