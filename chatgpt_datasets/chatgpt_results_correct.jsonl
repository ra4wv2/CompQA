In most benchmarks it is only about 20% slower than the Samsung which is still 100% faster than a mechanical drive.\n3. The Samsung drives are slightly faster than the Toshiba drives.\n4. I'm honor-bound to mention that, statistically speaking, the Toshiba picture is inferior to that of the Samsung, outputting at 1080i (\"i\" for interlaced) instead of the superior 1080p.\n5. With 552 MB/s, it is only marginally slower than the competing model from Samsung, but in writing it is significantly faster with 521 MB/s vs. 468 MB/s.\n6. The Samsung takes second place, being just a little faster than the Toshiba.\n7. Samsung SSDs read and write speeds are significantly faster than the Toshiba SSDs.\n8. In the widespread Quadrant Standard benchmark the Toshiba AT200 scores 1486 points and is greatly inferior to the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 , which reached 2300 points.\n9. The problem is that the Toshiba drives are noticeably slower than the newer Samsung drives.\n10. My 5 years old Samsung looks better than my year old Toshiba.\n11. Lighter and slightly smaller than the HP14, better build quality than the 720 (hopefully), and looks somewhat similar to the samsung in my opinion.\n12. The slower Toshiba (150/150) and the faster Samsung (255/255).\n13. It's superior to its closest rivals, the iPad 2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 , but inferior to the likes of the Toshiba AT200 or heavyweights such as the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet.\n14. Notably, however, it was also much slower than the Toshiba HK3R, which had a raw score even faster than the Samsung 840 EVO's (7,464).\n15. In our CPU limited in-house tests it proved quicker than both the Samsung X360 and the Sony VAIO TT, particularly in the video rendering test where it was around 15 per cent faster than the Samsung and 20 per cent faster than the Sony.\n16. However, when switching from apps to the home screen, the Samsung was a hair slower than the Toshiba, whose animations were also smoother.\n17. - The Toshiba starts much faster then the Samsung.\n18. For HD content, this TV's PQ is no inferior to my SAMSUNG (D7000 model).\n19. These reports seem to indicate the 11-inch models and the 256GB 13-inch model are using the faster Samsung drives, whereas the 128GB 13-inch model is using the slower Toshiba drive.\n20.

Under heavy loads, stone is superior to wood but not to iron, steel, or reinforced concrete.\n3. Plus, stone and wood look nicer and more impressive than steel and concrete.\n4. The building's surface was made out of concrete to reduce the cost, inferior to the stone finish that Wright had wanted.\n5. Stepping Stone Construction Lighter than concrete and will not crack over time.\n6. The performance and durability of our paving stone is far superior to that of traditional concrete, while its beauty rivals that of natural stone.\n7. The surfaces of the particles being generally smooth give perhaps a poorer bond with the cement than most broken stone.\n8. Fiber stone contains a mixture of sand, stones and fiberglass to be stronger but lighter than concrete.\n9. Natural Stone Pavers are very durable and much nicer looking than a man made concrete or brick paver.\n10. Hypertufa is a simulated stone container that is durable in all weather conditions, but lighter-weight than solid stone or concrete.\n11. This solution is faster, simpler and far more affordable than using natural stone, bricks or pavers.\n12. From an installation standpoint, it is typically simpler to install, and it is also usually easier to provide uniformity in thickness and color than when working with natural stone.\n13. When these conditions are not met, specially designed concrete units for armoring the face of the rubble-mound have been developed that tend to interlock better than rock when properly placed; hence, it may be possible to use armor units lighter than the required quarry-stone.\n14. Precast concrete is lighter and more versatile than stone.\n15.

Stanford has a much greater \"normal person\" component (athletes, dumb rich kids) than MIT.\n4. Berkeley and Stanford are better than the first two, but I would still say MIT (with Lippard, Schrock, Cummins, etc.) is superior.\n5. So it is well known that grading at Stanford or Harvard is easier than grading at MIT or Caltech.\n6. The kind of entrepeneurial teaching at Stanford and UCSF is IMHO superior to MIT and Harvard, and it is a bonus to be so close to Silicon Valley.\n7. We know Stanford is better at fundraising than schools like MIT, but there's obviously a lot more to it than that.\n8. I am not trying to use NRC ranking to prove that Stanford is better than MIT and Berkeley in EE.\n9. \"Mr. Stanford does better than Mr. Mississippi State, but Ms. Mississippi State does just as well as Ms. MIT,\" said Fisman.\n10. As to the economics of the exchange between Stanford and Podunk (how much can Stanford charge), that's a function of how many other providers there are offering the same product and whether the Stanford calc class is any better than the CalTech or MIT class.\n11. But I realized that the startup culture at MIT and Boston in general is not inferior to Stanford.\n12. MIT seems to have a slightly greater pedigree than Stanford.\n13. IMO MIT gives a better undergrad education than Stanford for Sciences and Engineering.\n14. Already, my Berkeley and MIT essays feel better than my UCLA and Stanford ones.\n15. MIT is often viewed as \"inbreeding central\": the chart though suggests that it is no worse than Stanford, and definitely not worse than CMU.\n16. With gifts and payout, that loss translated to an $11 billion decrease in Harvard's endowment-an amount greater than the total value of any other school's endowment except Yale, Princeton, and Stanford.\n17. Perhaps this nonprofit venture is a better method for online education than Udacity, the startup created by Stanford professors after their wildly successful free online course offerings.\n18. Years ago - and maybe it's true today - MIT had the reputation of having a better teaching environment than Harvard, Chicago, Stanford, etc.\n19. First, from working on a wartime military project at MIT, Terman realised that the electrical engineering programmes there and elsewhere on the east coast of the USA were far superior to those of Stanford, and he sought to emulate them.\n20.
