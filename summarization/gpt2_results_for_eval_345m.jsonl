Compared to other recent systems in an aligned region by region launch, the 3DS has reached 5m units slower than Wii, PSP, PS2 and DS but faster than X360 and PS3.\n11. PS3 is WAY WAY more superior, I KNOW because I HAVE a 360 AND PS3 and compared them both PS3 is obviosly better than 360 and wii.\n12. When people see how much better the EA Sports lineup is on a next gen console, combined with motion tech and better graphics and online scoreboards and online multiplayer thats much easier to manage than Wii, many people will begin trading for the superior console.\n13. MLB 2K9 for the Wii isn't a great baseball game, but superior controls and animation make it a bit better than its 360 and PS3 siblings.\n14.

None, WII U isn't next gen. 8 years ago consoles ruled over PC but then manufactures figured out how to deal with architecure better and now even GPU's are 30x times faster processors than PS3 and xbox.\n16. The bad: Reportedly reacts slightly slower than PS3 with Move, though still faster than Wii, and currently the smallest library with only 17 games currently available.\n17. But the PS3 was faster than the Xbox 360, which was faster than the Wii.\n18. You could see the Wii was inferior to the 360/Ps3.\n19.

Corrosion: Flame Safe exterior and interior fire retardant treated plywood and wood does not demonstrate any greater corrosion rate than untreated wood on metal fasteners or hardware .\n7. Sheet metal would be better than a piece of plywood as it is thinner so you can use the original bolts and it won't compress which would cause the bolts to loosen.\n8. If one wishes to minimise the weight of a craft like those used for fast electric racing, then aluminium can metal offers a better than 50% weight saving over thin plywood and costs even less, if you have first enjoyed the can contents!\n9. Plywood is much easier to work with than metal Mount the tv on the plywood and drill holes in the plywood for the bracket.\n10. It was safe to say we wanted to put something on it that would be better than bare metal!\n11. Made of special plywood of balsa sandwiched between birch, the Mosquito proved faster than any comparable metal aircraft.\n12.

This could be a very inexpensive RTA kit or big box store item and weigh less and ride better than a cheap metal frame.\n14. Bottom boards and telescoping covers - and even inner covers - plywood is better than masonite, granted those nice metal caps are VERY nice.\n15. I think perhaps two thin layers of wood alone versus the same two thin slices glued together into plywood would be better, or perhaps a metal alloy being better than either metal alone.\n16. \"Despite the fact that articles of plastics are usually lighter than those of metal and that economies may be affected in fabrication, the price differential between plastics and, for example, steel is so great as to discourage large-scale substitution.\n17. Made of a resin material, the clear polycarbonate storm panel can completely cover a window or door and has four times the impact resistance of plywood while being 30 percent to 50 percent lighter than metal panels, the maker claims.\n18.

It is also said to dissipate heat faster than high carbon steel [2] and is a cost-effective option for breakwalls [3]. However, others argue that steel frames tend to be more cumbersome and expensive [1], and may not be as readily accessible for break-walls [2].\n\nOn the other hand, plywood is said to be easier to work with and to yield better results than steel [12], and it is also cheaper and lighter than metal [7]. However, plywood may not be as durable as steel [18], and it may not be cost-effective to replace broken pieces [10].\n\nUltimately, the choice between metal and plywood may depend on the specific needs and priorities of the builder or designer.
